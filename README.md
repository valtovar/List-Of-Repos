# List-Of-Repos
This is a list of forked repos.  It includes repos of game engines, graphics libraries, physics frameworks and web development. As **GitHub** doesn't support folders, I had to create **"new companies"** to group these repos by **categories** like **"Game Engines"**, **"Frameworks"** and **"Libraries"**. Below, a short description of each one.


**Game Engines:**
* *Link*: https://github.com/ValtoGameEngines
* *Description*: It includes a list of open source game engines as **CryEngine 5**, **Xenko Game Engine** and **Banshee Engine**, and more.


**Frameworks:**
* *Link*: https://github.com/ValtoFrameworks
* *Description*: Includes a list of open source frameworks for many areas. For example, *web development*: including **Angular2**, **Bootstrap 4** and **Symfony 3**; *rendering*: including **Magnum** and **BGFX**; And *API ports* as **SharpDX - DirectX port to C#**, **OpenTK - OpenGL port to C#**, and **VulkanSharp - Vulkan port to C#**.


**Libraries:**
